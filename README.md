# iwantlawyer

Recreating the first website I built back in 2005. I created it for my friend who had just started his own law firm. Over the past 20 years, the business has experienced significant growth and expanded into international markets. I need to rebuild a better website for him. Wish me luck â€” it's the new and improved iwantlawyer.com.
